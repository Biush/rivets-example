# How Do I Rivets

A buddy recently turned me on to [rivets js](http://www.rivetsjs.com/). Besides being bundled with the epic [ember js](http://emberjs.com/) framework, it's a sleek little stand alone lib. Rivets is a [templating system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript_templating), which in and of itself is not so revolutionary, except unlike handlebars or mustache it has built in two-way binding. This means that, assuming everything is configured to properly, when you update your data object the DOM will auto-magically update, and when you update properly associated DOM elements the data model will update. A one and done, one stop shop, configure your page and don't worry about your view and your data falling out of sync again.
